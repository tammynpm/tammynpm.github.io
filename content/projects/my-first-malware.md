# How I created a YARA Rule Challenge for MinutemanCTF2025

Before we start, all creds go to Jeremy Dunn for this original idea.

> Fun Facts: I almost fully switched to Linux, but this project held me back to Windows.

# YARA
`Yet Another Recursive Anonym` a.k.a YARA are rules used to detect malware in a file. 

A YARA rule typically looks like this: 

```
rule sakula-detect{
    strings: 
        $pattern1=".exe"
        $pattern2="http"
    condition:
        all of them
}
```

# Lessons

After hearing feedback from the players, I realize the challenge might be too ambiguous and did not express the idea of forensics.

One thing I would change if I could go back time is give out more context around the attack and build the challenge based on actual CVEs or attacks. 

After a few months playing CTFs consistently, I realized the practicality lack of CTF challenges. Not all challenges are created equally (not for throwing shame at authors -- I know first hand making challenges could have lots of overhead). 

I definitely learned a lot making this challenge.
