<!-- Hi, my name is Tammy Nguyen. I'm a CS student at UMass Amherst, with a passion for low-level learning, programming, and software. My current interests lie in Network Security and HomeLabbing. 

I have a mini homelab setup with several self-hosted services running on it.  

I'm a hobbyist CTF player with SavedByTheShell Team. 

My superpower is killing the mood. My sense of humor is a bit dry, so if I say something awkward, just know I'm probably judging myself more than you are. 

You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammy-pm-nguyen/), Spotify, and [GitHub](https://github.com/tammynpm).  -->
