I'm a CS student with a passion for low-level learning, programming, and software. My current interests lie in Network Security and HomeLabbing. 

I like exploring the cities, or sitting at home and binge-watching movies (I can bet on any Tom Cruise's movie any day of the week!).

My superpower is killing the mood. My sense of humor is a bit dry, so if I say something awkward, just know I'm probably judging myself more than you are. 

You can find me on Linkedin, Spotify, and GitHub of course!
