  <p>There are many types of file systems (fs). What do we need to know to learn about disk analysis?</p>
<p>FAT fs has a field that identifies how many sectors are in a cluster, and it must have a value that is a power of 2.</p>
<p>A Linux tool that is used for partition recovery is <code>gpart</code>.</p>
<p>The NTFS has 2048-byte clusters and 512-byte sectors.</p>
<p>All file systems have slack space because all file systems allocate data in multiple-byte chunks instead of in individual bytes. Slack space is considered allocated data, but if you extract the unallocated data from a file system, it should not include the slack space of a file.</p>
<p>There are two major ways to recover deleted files: metadata-based and application-based.
Metadata-based recovery works when metadata from the deleted file still exists. In the case it was wiped or reallocated to a new file, then we need to rely on application-based method.</p>
<p>The OS has a big decision here.</p>
<p>Most of the time, we can use the metadata to view file contents, search for values, and locate deleted files.</p>
<p>How does <code>fls</code> work? Why in some case, <code>file</code> can do a better job than <code>fls</code>? Let&rsquo;s dive a little bit in some of the most used The Sleuth Kit (TSK) commands.</p>
<p>To effectively use <code>fls</code>, we should incorporate <code>mmls</code> at the same time in order to locate the block position of where the MBR is.</p>
<p>In what way would you need to recover lost things?</p>
<p>Imagine that you have a 5TB hard disk (HDD) that holds years of your family photos and videos. And one day, when you take it out to connect to a big monitor to see these old photos again, you drop the hard disk on the ground.</p>
<p>Btw, this actually happened to my dad&rsquo;s HDD that held many photos of his children when they were young.</p>
<h1 id="guid-lba-and-protective-mbr">GUID, LBA and protective MBR</h1>
<p>the protective MBR locates at LBA 0 for a bootable disk if the disk has GPT layout.
Why MBR still exists in GPT? for backward compability.</p>
<p>you can carve out a file</p>
